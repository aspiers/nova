    Compute drivers now expose capabilities via traits in the
    Placement API.  Typically capabilities will map to standard traits
    defined in the os-traits project; for now these are:

    * COMPUTE_NET_ATTACH_INTERFACE
    * COMPUTE_DEVICE_TAGGING
    * COMPUTE_NET_ATTACH_INTERFACE_WITH_TAG
    * COMPUTE_VOLUME_ATTACH_WITH_TAG
    * COMPUTE_VOLUME_EXTEND
    * COMPUTE_VOLUME_MULTI_ATTACH
    * COMPUTE_TRUSTED_CERTS

    However there are also some non-standard traits which have a
    ``CUSTOM_COMPUTE_`` prefix:

    * CUSTOM_COMPUTE_HAS_IMAGECACHE
    * CUSTOM_COMPUTE_SUPPORTS_EVACUATE
    * CUSTOM_COMPUTE_SUPPORTS_MIGRATE_TO_SAME_HOST

    Any traits provided by the driver will be automatically added
    during startup or a periodic update of a compute node.  Similarly
    any traits later retracted by the driver will be automatically
    removed.

    However any custom traits which are removed from the Placement API
    via the admin will not be reinstated until the compute service's
    provider cache is reset.  This can be triggered via a SIGHUP.
